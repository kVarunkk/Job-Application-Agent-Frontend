    2. **Be Inclusive:** Do not discard jobs just because they have a different title or a slightly different seniority level, provided the technical skills overlap significantly (e.g., a "Frontend Engineer" is highly relevant to a "Javascript Developer" role).
    3. **Filter Only Extremes:** Only exclude jobs that are completely unrelated in domain or function (e.g., exclude a 'Sales Executive' if the target is 'Software Engineer'). 
    4. **Output Format:** Return a JSON object with a key "ranked_ids" containing an array of IDs in order of relevance.
